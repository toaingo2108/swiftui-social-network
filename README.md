# SwiftUI Social Network
Social Network in SwiftUI with MVVM, 
Firebase for Login/Register and other database.


- Using Firebase 
  - Login with email
  - Register with email
- Firestore
  - Save all details of register user
  - Upload profile picture
- Post like
- Publish the post

To launch the mobile app, you will need:
1. Create a Firebase account (App).
2. Add the GoogleService-Info.plist file with your app data to the project (generated by Firebase).
3. Enable Authentication in Firebase (Sign-in providers): Email/Password.
4. Check and adjust the access rights of the Firestore Database (Cloud Firestore).

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## Contacts

I have a clear focus on time-to-market and don't prioritize technical debt. And I took part in the Pre-Sale/RFX activity as a System Architect, assessment efforts for Mobile (iOS-Swift, Android-Kotlin), Frontend (React-TypeScript) and Backend (NodeJS-.NET-PHP-Kafka-SQL-NoSQL). And I also formed the work of Pre-Sale as a CTO from Opportunity to Proposal via knowledge transfer to Successful Delivery.
